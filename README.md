# Technician Performance Ranking Model 

## Overview
This project demonstrates a robust analytical framework for ranking field technicians based on **profitability** while accounting for **work quality** and **job volume volatility**.

The original model was deployed to rank thousands of technicians using live data from Snowflake. This public version uses **synthetic data generation** to replicate the data structures and statistical properties of the real-world dataset, allowing for a full demonstration of the ranking logic without compromising sensitive internal data.

## The Business Problem
Ranking technicians purely on "Average Profit per Job" is flawed because:
1.  **Sample Size Variance:** A technician with 1 lucky high-profit job shouldn't rank higher than a veteran with 1,000 consistent jobs.
2.  **Quality Blindness:** High-speed, high-profit technicians might be cutting corners, leading to repeat visits (Recalls), which hurts long-term value.

## The Solution: Quality Adjusted Bayesian Ranking
We implemented a multi-stage ranking algorithm:

### 1. Bayesian Smoothing (Reliability)
We use a **Bayesian Average** to shrink the profit scores of low-volume technicians towards the company global average. This ensures that to rank high, a technician needs *both* high profit *and* sufficient evidence (job volume).

$$ S_{profit} = \frac{v}{v+m} R + \frac{m}{v+m} C $$

*   **$R$:** Technician's Average Profit.
*   **$v$:** Technician's Job Count.
*   **$C$:** Global Company Average Profit (Prior).
*   **$m$:** Smoothing Factor (Median Job Volume).

### 2. Recall Rate Penalty (Quality)
We apply a penalty multiplier based on the technician's **Recall Rate** (percentage of jobs requiring a repeat visit within 30 days).

$$ S_{final} = S_{profit} \times (1 - \text{Recall Rate}) $$

*   *Example:* A technician with a 10% recall rate sees their profit score discounted by 10%.

## Project Structure
*   `Technician_Ranking_Public_Demo.py`: The main Python script.
    *   **Data Generation:** Creates synthetic datasets for Technicians and Company Financials using `numpy` distributions (Poisson for volume, Normal for profit, Binomial for recalls).
    *   **Model Logic:** Implements the Bayesian and Quality scoring algorithms.
    *   **Reporting:** Generates an HTML executive summary.
*   `Technician_Performance_Report_Public.html`: The output report generated by the script.

## How to Run
1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy ipython
    ```
2.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python Technician_Ranking_Public_Demo.py
    ```
3.  View the console output for top/bottom rankings and open the generated HTML file for the executive dashboard.

## Tech Stack
*   **Python** (Core Logic)
*   **Pandas / NumPy** (Data Manipulation & Statistical Generation)
*   **HTML/CSS** (Automated Reporting)
